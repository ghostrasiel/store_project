So, we\\'re doing our part to help facilitate more such meetings among friends. Toward that end, we think our new Matcha Green Tea is a great start. It\\'s hard to find time to slow down and taste the tea in your busy routine, but these individual packets of real Matcha Green Tea provide an easy way to brew an authentic, quality cup-anytime, anywhere. Our vibrant emerald-green tea powder comes from tea leaves that are grown and ground for us in Japan. Brewed, it has a rich taste that presents a delicate hint of sweetness. Each 1.5 gram packet (there are seven in the box) is the perfect amount to mix with eight ounces of hot water for a steaming cup of Matcha... better make it two! Ichi-go, Ichi-e.

If you’re a dog, any opportunity to get your chompers on some corned beef is solely associated with awesome. Our canine cuddlers don’t care when or where, they just love the stuff. So it occurred to us to give them what they want (the dog people reading this will surely understand). That impulse led to the development of Trader Joe’s Deli Style Corned Beef Flavor Dog Treats.Inside every bag you’ll find soft, jerky-like treats made with beef (the first ingredient!) and a short list of ingredients that includes seasonings used to make traditional corned beef. The treats are grain free, and easy to break into smaller pieces for a pint-sized pooch. When’s the right time to share these Treats with your pup? Sit! Stay! Come! Roll over! In fact, there’s no wrong time, and your doggo will howl with delight every time. (There’s also nothing stopping you from using them to make a canine corned beef hash, if that’s how much you love your pup.)

Trader Joe’s Cheddar & Gruyere Mèlange, however, is so deeply rooted in the land, that the only way to completely understand it is to go back just that far. What is now northwestern Wisconsin was once barren land covered with glaciers. As the glaciers melted, they left behind a countryside of rolling hills and pasturelands, pasturelands that now serve as the main diet of the cows that produce the milk used to craft Trader Joe’s Cheddar & Gruyere Mèlange. So, when you think about it, it all goes back to the glaciers. People talk about terroir in relation to wines: this brief history is testimony to the fact that it can be just as appropriate in describing certain cheeses. The history of Cheddar & Gruyere Mèlange at Trader Joe’s isn’t quite as ancient as the glaciers, but we have featured it in our cheese case for more than a decade.

It’s crafted for us by master cheesemakers in Wisconsin, who take blocks of rich, thick, cow’s milk cheese, cover them in garlic powder, then bake them to a beautifully golden-brown hue. Known in its native Finland as juustolepä, Bread Cheese contains no wheat, or gluten, nor anything else of that nature, but rather gets its name from its hearty, remarkably bread-like consistency and squeaky, Halloumi-like texture. And much like Halloumi, Trader Joe’s Garlic Bread Cheese is best served nice and warm, after it’s had a chance to get just a little melty and gooey. Fun fact: in Finland, Bread Cheese is typically eaten in the morning, dunked in coffee. We find that the bold and savory notes of garlic in this Bread Cheese are better suited for a bit of Organic Marinara Sauce, ourselves.', '價格': '3.99', '大分類': 'Food', '中分類': 'Cheese', '圖片url': 'https://www.traderjoes.com//content/dam/trjo/products/m20203/71622.png', '圖片名': 'Garlic Bread Cheese.jpg', '路徑': './Amazon_image/Garlic Bread Cheese.jpg'}, {'商品名': 'White Rum of the Gods', '規格': '750 mL', '描述': 'If you like makin’ drinks at sunset,If you blend or you shake,Then I’m the rum that you’ve looked for,Take a sip and escape.-with apologies to Rupert HolmesAvast, me hearties! If you’re looking for a superb summer spirit that plays well with others, then say “Ahoy!” to Trader Joe’s White Rum Of The Gods. Made of pure cane sugar and distilled in Barbados (aka the birthplace of rum), it’s a clear, 80-proof (40% ABV) liquor that offers a soft hint of allspice in the nose, and a light caramel-sweetness on the palate with a clean finish. This fairly neutral flavor profile makes it a marvelous mixing partner, whether you prefer a Daiquiri, Mojito, or of course, a Piña Colada.After it’s distilled in Barbados, this White Rum Of The Gods travels the high seas (and then the highways) in bulk via “flexi-tanks” to a bottling plant in Wisconsin. This reduces the cost of transportation, without sacrificing the quality and authenticity of what’s inside the bottle—which is why we’re able to offer 750mL bottles of Trader Joe’s White Rum of the Gods for a few doubloons…er, dollars lower per bottle than we’ve seen elsewhere.

Now in its third season in the TJ’s freezers, for some, our Ube Ice Cream needs no introduction. For those not yet in-the-know, allow us to give you the 411 on this not-to-be-missed flavor of the summer.Purple yams are known as Ube (that’s oo-beh) in the Philippines, where they’re used to make all kinds of goodies – from jams to cakes, candies to ice cream! Every Ube Ice Cream we’ve tried is delish, yet surprisingly, some don’t actually contain ube purée (weird, right?). Ours does! The result is creamy, sweet, nutty, and beautiful to behold! The purple hue comes courtesy of ingredients like grape extract and beet juice. From a flavor perspective, it’s been likened to a cross between vanilla and pistachio, with a hint of coconut. We can’t get enough of it. That’s not a figure of speech; we truly can’t.

And so it goes for Key Lime Pie, a treasure of the Florida Keys. We know for certain it originated in Key West in the 1850’s, and we know the key to the magic was (and is) canned sweetened condensed milk, which allowed cooks without easy access to refrigeration to quickly and easily make treats like ice cream or custard. Beyond that, the history gets murky, and really depends on whose story you choose to believe. We do believe that all roads lead to the freezer case at Trader Joe’s. As tradition dictates, Trader Joe’s Key Lime Pie is made with sweetened condensed milk and true Key lime juice. Unlike other lime juices, Key lime juice is pale yellow in color. Some pies bearing the Key Lime name are bright green – we can assure you that this is not a natural occurrence, but rather the result of the inclusion of artificial color. The filling of our Key Lime Pie is pale yellow, just as it should be.

In recent years, the process of ultra-filtration has grown in popularity, too. Ultra-filtered milk is created by filtering the milk with a membrane so fine that it actually removes the lactose, as well as some of the sugars that naturally occur in milk. It also creates a milk that’s considerably higher in protein and calcium than normal, and even tastes a little creamier. Sounds amazing, right? We thought so too, which is why we decided to bring Trader Joe’s Ultra-Filtered Milk to our refrigerators.Aside from being ultra-smooth and ultra-creamy, this 2% milkfat Ultra-filtered Milk is certified lactose free, and made using milk from cows not treated with rBST.

The verdict was the same as every other time it had been tried: WOW. Our Mediterranean Style Orzo Pasta Salad, like Carmen’s, starts with a pasta salad made up of orzo, crumbled feta cheese, diced red onion, Kalamata olives, and sun dried tomatoes. It’s then tossed in a golden balsamic dressing and basil pesto and topped with shredded spinach—yes, a pasta salad that actually has some “salad”! The spinach-on-top layering ensures fresh leaves when it comes time to enjoy. Its savory and salty flavors perfectly evoke its regional namesake—it’ll be almost as if you traveled there! Such a delicious Orzo Pasta Salad has so many moments to shine. Bring a few containers to that last-minute BBQ your neighbor is throwing, or enjoy it with grilled fish for a tasty lunch.

It's a full-flavored and easy-going coffee, sold pre-ground to help those seeking to minimize their morning rush.We start with a blend of 100% Arabica beans from Guatemala and Ethiopia and heat them to an ideal light roast profile: pleasantly light brown in color, mellow aromatics, and roast just enough to bring out the full body and fruitiness of the Ethiopian beans without sacrificing the acidity and sweet notes of the Guatemalan. Then, we grind the beans so you won't have to, just before sealing them into our nitrogen-flushed-for-freshness canister.This means, at home you'll be able to open the top and immediately spoon fresh grounds into your coffeemaker. No noisy grinder disturbing the peace, and much less counter mess.

Honestly, you could go even farther and call it our Pumpkin Bread and Pumpkin Butter.But we hope that in all the pumpkin craze, we don't overshadow one of the best parts of the pumpkin, the seed. Pumpkin seeds, also known as pepitas, are an exceptionally crunchy, slightly nutty, deliciously flavorful treat that can bring a serious savory factor to pretty much anything they're added to, be it a pesto sauce, trail mix, or Trader Joe's Pepita Salsa.By combining the bright, zesty tomato and pepper flavors of a traditional chunky salsa with the texture and nuttiness of finely chopped pepitas, our Pepita Salsa has created a savory synthesis of seed and spice. Not only do the pepitas add a nice thickness to the salsa's body, making it even easier to scoop up with a tortilla or corn chip, but their hearty, earthy flavor expertly balances the acidity of the tomatoes and vinegar.On top of that, each bite of Pepita Salsa also carries the delicate sweet heat of puréed bell pepper and chipotle spices, making this one seriously satisfying salsa.Please join us in welcoming Trader Joe's Pepita Salsa to our legendary family of pumpkin products.

Finally, they are pressed back into flattened rounds.

The crispy, crunchy, dried garlic and onion creates a delightfully bold, verging-on-umami base, while dried red bell pepper and chili flakes build onto that with complementary smoky, slightly sweet, subtly spicy notes.

Like their potato prototype, they're lightly fried (in sunflower oil) until they're perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside and make a fine side dish or snack, too. They're cheesy (Parmesan cheese), onion-y (leeks), and ready to be devoured.Serve them with applesauce. Top them with sour cream and Trader Joe's Fried Onion Pieces.

For example, if you're looking for something quick, convenient, tasty, and filling, you can't beat a frozen burrito. If you're more in the mood for something gooey, cheesy, and easy, you can't beat a frozen quesadilla. And if you want both? To paraphrase an old adage, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em together.Cleverly crossed between a burrito and quesadilla, our new Hatch Chile Chicken Wraps provide a one-two punch of cheesy, filling, hatch chile-spiced deliciosity, conveniently packaged in an easy-to-handle, hexagonally-folded tortilla. Once cooked (either in the oven, microwave, or, our favorite method, defrosted and then grilled on a skillet with a bit of butter or olive oil until heated through and crisp on the outside), each Wrap is like a portable pocket of delectable grilled chicken, savory black beans, melty mozzarella and Monterey jack cheeses, and fiery hatch chile and jalapeño.

That's why, when the time came to find a medium for a crouton that was delightfully crunchy, but still decidedly gluten free, we knew that one fruit would stand head and shoulders above the rest of the bunch. Now, Trader Joe's Plantain Croutons are here to provide some resounding crunch, along with gratifyingly garlicky seasoning, to salads, soups, and anything else that might benefit from a bit of extra flavor and texture.These Plantain Croutons are made especially for us by a supplier in Ecuador who specializes in plantain-based snacks. One of the reasons they work so well is that they use green plantains, which are slightly starchier and lower in sugar, and have an almost potato-like texture.

In true bean-to-bar fashion, the cacao is harvested, dried, and fermented in partnership with a 3rd generation, family-owned Italian chocolatier. But don't assume this partnership is a long-distance relationship. In fact, one of the Italian Executive Directors is based in Uganda where he helps guarantee the origin of the beans from Ugandan farmers who still own the lands on which the cacao is cultivated.

Xiao long bao are traditionally filled with pork, so this second entry in our freezers adheres closer to culinary tradition.Where we've veered from the traditional preparation is with the inclusion of ginger as a major flavor player. Our recipe includes just a bit more than five percent ginger, giving these dim sum darlings a sizeable kick of pungent, spicy heat.
